# OSHConnect-Python

OSHConnect-Python is the Python member of the OSHConnect family of application
libraries. It provides a simple, straightforward way to interact with
OpenSensorHub (or any other OGC API – Connected Systems server).

It supports Parts 1, 2, and 3 (Pub/Sub) of the OGC Connected Systems API,
including:

- System, Datastream, and ControlStream discovery and management
- Real-time MQTT streaming using CS API Part 3 `:data` topic conventions
- Resource event topic subscriptions (CloudEvents lifecycle notifications)
- Batch retrieval and archival stream playback
- Configuration persistence (JSON save/load)
- SWE Common schema builders for defining datastream and command schemas

All major classes and utilities are importable directly from `oshconnect`.
Lower-level CS API utilities are available from `oshconnect.csapi4py`.
